## 1. Set up `.env`.

Copy `.env.example` to create a `.env` file and put the private key you want to use in `RAW_PRIVATE_KEY`.

## 2. Modify the values of `MEMO` and `NCG_AMOUNT`.

In the `index.ts` file, you need to modify the following parts. In `MEMO`, you need to enter the address to receive WNCG from the Ethereum side. In `NCG_AMOUNT` you need to write the amount of NCG to be bridged. It has 2 decimal places, so if you want to convert 1 NCG to WNCG, you need to enter `100n`.

```typescript
const MEMO = "<ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>";
const NCG_AMOUNT = 1n; // An amount to send. This must be a decimalized value. If you want to send "1.00" NCG, this value should be 100n.
```
